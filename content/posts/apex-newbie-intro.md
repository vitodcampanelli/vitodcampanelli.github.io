It took a long time to decide on a blog title and truth be told I am not really an APEX newbie. I started working with APEX when it was HTMLDB 1.5 or 1.6. **WOW!!** The changes have been phenomenal.

Back to my story, APEX newbie not really, but that is how I think of myself. When I started at my position, I had the freedom to test and play with various technologies. I came across APEX and after giving it a test run, I decided to install it directly into our production database. Literally months on the job and I took a leap of faith. 

## History
Over the years, I basically used APEX to migrate legacy Oracle forms, Access databases and the dreaded Excel spreadsheets. I never strayed far from the basic APEX wizards to create forms and reports, **never** really had a need to either. I always kept to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). 

A couple of months before I made the decision to proceed with APEX, I had a chance to see a presentation given by Tom Kyte. Something he said struck me. I am paraphrasing here: *"Anaylse your problem and come up with a solution. Use SQL to solve your problem, if you can't solve it using SQL, try PL/SQL if you can't solve it using PL/SQL, rethink your solution."* With APEX that sentence resounitated, I was able to just use SQL to solve most of my problem. And the love story began.

## Fast-foward to June 2016
I had the chance to attend KScope 2016, that is where everything changed for me and APEX. I saw how great the APEX community was and is, how wonderful and helpful the people are. I got to meet some of the developers that worked on and with APEX, SQLDeveloper, and ORDS. Being able to attend the sessions and seeing how others solve their business requirements using APEX opened up my eyes to features I had been missing for years.

Things I took away from KScope that I wanted to share with the true APEX newbies are:

1. If you are not on [Twitter](https://twitter.com), get on it now, and follow the hastag [#ORCLAPEX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ORCLAPEX)
2. Join [ODTUG](https://www.odtug.com)
3. Search and follow APEX people on Twitter and read their blogs. There are too many people to list, and afraid I would miss some, if I were to provide a list.
4. Register for a free workspace [https://apex.oracle.com/en/](https://apex.oracle.com/en/)
4. Don't be shy to ask questions, the APEX community is awesome.
5. Start a blog and share your experiences.

I can’t just stop without talking about the BEST part of KScope, The People. I’ve met some great people at KScope.  I’ve forged strong friendships; Made new fiends; Learned from the best in the APEX and Oracle community; I have been inspired and motivated by them.

In the days since I got back, I find myself energized with ideas. I think there’s an extra twinkle in my eye and I feel ready to takle new challenges.


I honestly believe that I am still learning all the great things APEX is capable of doing. until very recently I have been creating APEX applications which would replace Oracle forms, Access database the dreaded Excel spreadsheets. I never strayed to far from the basic wizards in APEX to recreated what I needed.
