It took a long time to decide on a blog title and truth be told I am not really an APEX newbie. I started working with APEX when it was HTMLDB 1.5 or 1.6. **WOW!!** The changes have been phenomenal.

Back to my story, APEX newbie not really, but that is how I think of myself. When I started at my position, I had the freedom to test and play with various technologies. I came across APEX and after giving it a test run, I decided to install it directly into our production database. Literally months on the job and I took a leap of faith. 

## History
Over the years, I basically used APEX to migrate legacy Oracle forms, Access databases and the dreaded Excel spreadsheets. I never strayed far from the basic APEX wizards to create forms and reports, **never** really had a need to either. I always kept to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). 

A couple of months before I made the decision to proceed with APEX, I had a chance to see a presentation given by Tom Kyte. Something he said struck me. I am paraphrasing here: *"Anaylse your problem and come up with a solution. Use SQL to solve your problem, if you can't solve it using SQL, try PL/SQL if you can't solve it using PL/SQL, rethink your solution."* With APEX that sentence resounitated, I was able to just use SQL to solve most of my problem. And the love story began.

## Fast-foward to June 2016
I had the chance to attend [KScope](https://kscope18.odtug.com/) 2016 in Chicago, that is where everything changed for me and APEX. I saw how great the APEX and Oracle community was and is. I got to meet great presentators and made some awesome friends. Being able to attend the sessions, seeing how others solve their business requirements using APEX opened up my eyes to features I had been missing for years. KScope was truely a career changing experience. I came back to the office armed with fresh ideas and shared them with my team. I can honestly say that my entire team has benefited from it.

I know it is almost two years ago, but I find, it is never too late to share your experience with others willing to listen. Here is a short list of things I took away from KScope that I wanted to share with the true APEX newbies are:

1. If you are not on [Twitter](https://twitter.com), get on it now, and follow the hastag [#ORCLAPEX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ORCLAPEX)
2. Join [ODTUG](https://www.odtug.com)
3. Search and follow APEX people on Twitter and read their blogs. There are too many people to list, and afraid I would miss some, if I were to provide a list.
4. Register for a free workspace [https://apex.oracle.com/en/](https://apex.oracle.com/en/)
4. Don't be shy to ask questions, the APEX community is awesome.
5. Start a blog and share your experiences.
6. If you get a chance attend KScope

#Future

Will I blog some more? Mhy honest answer is I don't know, I am very self-confident about sharing my code with the world, but heah, my first blog is done so you never know.
